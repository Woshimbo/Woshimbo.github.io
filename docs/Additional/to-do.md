Decoding a code.

1. Look up naming conventions for the date & time.

2. Discover different ways to interact with things
	- such as saving and reading
		-	writing and appending
			[	and working with the types of streams
		- if it's only that those things happen
	if it's only streams doing so.

1. Add minimization.

    - Add delay mechanism where it can become a way to have the background change itself for whatever purpose.

1. Python

2. Information Technology

	- The first thing I'll say is that me personally; I would say it again is that if you're getting in to this section, you want to learn programming languages and levels in order to fully understand what it truly is and I'd say it's very useful for creating handy tools.

3. Authentication

4. Servers

5. Clients

6. Ports

7. IP Addresses

Since touch is something that begins and ends itself its logical to have it assigned self.

If just main_view is called, it does not load the view, but needs to be checked to see what it's doing.

		1. Self reminders, focus on logging.

		2. See if keyboard can be changed to not change back to characters when space is pressed.
